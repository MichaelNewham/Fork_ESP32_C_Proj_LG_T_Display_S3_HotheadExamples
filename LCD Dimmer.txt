LCD Backlight LED Dimmer Circuit and Code
How to adjust the LCD backlight:
The Schematic:
(See T_Display_S3shematic.png)
says that GPIO38 is ESP_LCD_BLK, which can be PWM duty cycle controlled to enable the clever chip "AW9364DNR" to dim the four LCD LED backlights (LEDK1 ~ 4) here:
(See LCD_Dimmer.png)
Using LEDC you can control the display brightness.
Add this code to your Arduino Sketch:

To declarations:
const int ledPin = 38;
const int freq = 5000;
const int ledChannel = 0;
const int resolution = 8;

To void setup:
ledcSetup(ledChannel, freq, resolution);
ledcAttachPin(ledPin, ledChannel);

To void loop:
ledcWrite(ledChannel, 25);

Where "25" (fairly dim) is 25 of 255 max value.
Variable from 0 - 255

# LillyGO-T-display-S3-setup-and-examples
LilyGO T-Display S3 setup and examples for Arduino IDE.
These instructions DO NOT WORK for other LilyGO boards, especially the 
similarly named LilyGO T-Display!
The setup of the brand new LilyGO T-Display S3 is not well documented!
Here is what I found that works, with help from watching Youtuber Volos.
Included in this GitHub repository are detailed setup instructions and several
working, tested, examples.
 
Installation is "easy" if you know "exactly what to do!"

Press the green Code button to download the repo, expand the .zip file
and follow the setup text instructions!

Then open the text file "LilyGO T-Display-S3 Setup.txt"
